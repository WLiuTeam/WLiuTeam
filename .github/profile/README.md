> üëâ [Click here to join WLiuTeam](https://github.com/orgs/WLiuTeam/people)

We are delighted to announce the official launch of **WLiuTeam**, a collaborative hub dedicated to cutting-edge research and open-source development in **Optimization** with a special focus on:

- **Convex Optimization** ‚Äì scalable algorithms, duality theory, and efficient solvers  
- **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)** ‚Äì bridging data uncertainty and worst-case guarantees  
- **Power-System Optimization Under Uncertainty** ‚Äì from day-ahead unit commitment to real-time market clearing

Our mission is three-fold:  
1. **Share** high-quality code, benchmark instances, and reproducible workflows.  
2. **Connect** researchers, engineers, and students across the globe.  
3. **Advance** the state of the art in robust and convex formulations for energy systems.
