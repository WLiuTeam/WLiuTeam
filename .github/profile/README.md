We are delighted to announce the official launch of **WLiuTeam**, a collaborative hub dedicated to cutting-edge research and open-source development in **Optimization** with a special focus on:

- **Convex Optimization** ‚Äì scalable algorithms, duality theory, and efficient solvers  
- **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)** ‚Äì bridging data uncertainty and worst-case guarantees  
- **Power System Optimization Under Uncertainty** ‚Äì from day-ahead unit commitment to real-time market clearing under uncertainty

Our mission is three-fold:

1. **Share** high-quality code, benchmark instances, and reproducible workflows.  
2. **Connect** researchers, engineers, and students across the globe.  
3. **Advance** the state of the art in robust and convex formulations for energy systems.

**What you will find in this organization:**

- Public repositories of our latest models, datasets, and tutorials  
- Curated reading lists and lecture notes on convex and distributionally robust optimization  
- GitHub Discussions for Q&A and brainstorming  
- GitHub Actions‚Äìdriven CI pipelines ensuring every commit is tested and documented

**How to join**

If your work touches any of the above keywords‚Äîor you simply enjoy elegant mathematics that runs on real-world electrons‚Äî**we invite you to become a member**:

1. Visit [https://github.com/WLiuTeam](https://github.com/WLiuTeam)  
2. Click **‚ÄúJoin this organization‚Äù** (or reply to this invitation email)  
3. Introduce yourself in the pinned **Welcome** discussion so we can match you with projects and collaborators

Whether you contribute a pull request, open an issue, or share a paper, every contribution moves the frontier of **Power System Optimization Under Uncertainty** one step further.
